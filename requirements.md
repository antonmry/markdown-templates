# Software Requirements Specification

Template based on [IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications].

The system gives a high level overview of the software application to be built,
sets the tone for the project, defines what the long term objectives and goals
of the project are and gives all the team members working on the project absolute
clarity.

## Introduction

It provides an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of what the product
specifications and user requirements are and how the software would accomplish
it.

### Purpose

The goal of your project and the objectives it aims to accomplish.

### Document Conventions

The typographical methodologies followed within the document. For e.g. any
abbreviations, typographical stylization of content or change of fonts and its
significance.

### Intended audience

Describe which part of the SRS document is intended for which reader. Include a
list of all stakeholders of the project, developers, project managers, and
testers for better clarity.

### Scope

Specify how the software goals align with the overall business goals and outline
the benefits of the project to business.

### References

A list of other documents that the SRS document refers to including sources such
as websites or written literature.

## General description

The appropriation of requirements and implementation constraints gives the
general overview of the project in regards to what the areas of strength and
deficit are and how to tackle them.

### Product perspective

Describe the context and origin of the product.

### Product Features

A high level summary of the functions the software would perform and the
features to be included.

### User class and characteristics

A categorization and profiling of the users the software is intended for and
their classification into different user classes.

### Operating environment

Specification of the environment the software is being designed to operate in.

### Constraints

Any limiting factors that would pose challenge to the development of the
software. These include both design as well as implementation constraints.

### Assumptions and dependencies

A list of all assumptions that you have made regarding the software product and
the environment along with any external dependencies which may affect the
project.

## System requirements

### Functional requirements

All the requirements within the system or sub-system in order to determine the
output that the software is expected to give in relation to the given input.
These consist of the design requirements, graphics requirements, operating
system requirements and constraints if any.

## External interface requirements

### User Interfaces

The logic behind the interactions between the users and the software. This
includes the sample screen layout, buttons and functions that would appear on
every screen, messages to be displayed on each screen and the style guides to be
used.

### Hardware Interfaces

All the hardware-software interactions with the list of supported devices on
which the software is intended to run on, the network requirements along with
the list of communication protocols to be used.

### Communications Interfaces

Determination of all the communication standards to be utilized by the software
as a part of the project.

### Software Interfaces

The interaction of the software to be developed with other software components
such as frontend and the backend framework to the used, the database management
system and libraries describing the need and the purpose behind each of them.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance requirements

The performance requirements need to be specified for every functional
requirement. The rationale behind it also needs to be elaborated upon.

### Safety requirements

List out any safeguards that need to be incorporated as a measure against any
possible harm the use of the software application may cause.

### Security requirements

Privacy and data protection regulations that need to be adhered to while
designing of the product

### Software quality attributes

Detailing on the additional qualities that need to be incorporated within the
software like maintainability, adaptability, flexibility, usability, reliability,
portability etc.

### Other requirements

These may include the legal requirements, resource utilizations, future updates,
etc.
